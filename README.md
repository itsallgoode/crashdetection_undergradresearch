### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the code for my undergraduate research as part of the First Year Scholars program at Kennesaw State University. The esp32_to_mpu6050.ino file is for an ESP32 microcontroller with bluetooth capabilities. This code pairs the microcontroller with the Xcode app in the crashdetect file. The information from the accelerometer as well as crash notifications are sent to the app through bluetooth.
